# Model Folder Overview

This folder contains two subdirectories for implementing the same model in two different deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and Keras.

## Structure

- `models/` : Contains the code for the model in PyTorch
- `keras_models/` : Contains the code for the model in Keras

## Models

### PyTorch Model

The `models` folder contains the implementation of the model using the PyTorch framework. It consists of the following files:

- `models.py` : Defines the architecture and methods for the PyTorch model

### Keras Model

The `keras_models` folder contains the implementation of the model using the Keras framework. It consists of the following files:

- `keras_models.py` : Defines the architecture and methods for the Keras model
